        "Notice that the scatter plot of the features vs. the label is a three dimensional (3-D) plot. This representation allows you to visualize both features and the label all together. The two features (TRIP_MILES and TRIP_MINUTES) are on the x and y axis, and the label (FARE) is on the z axis. The plot shows individual examples in the dataset as circles, and the model as a surface (plane). With this 3-D model, if the trained model is good you would expect most of the examples to land on the plane surface. The 3-D plot is interactive so you can explore the data further by clicking or dragging the plot."
